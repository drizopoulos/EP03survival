<h3>Question 4</h3>
<p>A randomized study has been performed to assess the efficacy and safety of a new drug for AIDS. Patients were randomized either to the new drug or to the standard treatment, and the primary outcome was time to death. We have collected data from 55 different centers and we would like to test whether the new treatment significantly prolongs survival over all the centers (i.e., we want the pooled effect). Relatively few deaths have been recorded during follow-up, and in some centers we did not have any event.</p>

<h2>Exercises</h2>
<p>The purpose of these exercises is to illustrate how to a representative Cox PH regression analysis including the extensions seen in the last sections of Chapter 4 and in Chapter 5.</p>
<p>The following questions are based on the Lung data set. This data set is available as the object <code>lung</code> from package <strong>survival</strong>, which is already loaded in this session. From this data set we will use the following variables:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>time</code>: the observed time-to-death in days.</p></li>
<li><p><code>status</code>: the event indicator; ‘1’ denotes censored and ‘2’ denotes death.</p></li>
<li><p><code>age</code>: the age in years.</p></li>
<li><p><code>ph.karno</code>: Karnofsky performance score rated by the physician.</p></li>
<li><p><code>sex</code>: the sex indicator with values ‘male’ and ‘female’.</p></li>
<li><p><code>ph.ecog</code>: ECOG performance score (0=good 5=dead).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For the exercises below it will be rather useful to check the corresponding sections of the <a href="http://www.drizopoulos.com/courses/EMC/EP03_%20Survival%20Analysis%20in%20R%20Companion.html">Survival Analysis in R Companion</a> that are given in the hints.</p>
<div id="section-question-1-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Question 1</h3>
<p>Our initial hypothesis is that the time-to-death is affected by <code>sex</code>, <code>age</code> and <code>ph.karno</code>. In addition, the physicians believe that the effect of <code>ph.karno</code> and <code>age</code> may be nonlinear in the log-hazard scale. Moreover, the (possibly nonlinear – model using natural cubic splines with 3 degrees of freedom) effects of <code>age</code> and <code>ph.karno</code> on the log-hazard scale are not the same for males and females. Transform this initial hypothesis into a suitable Cox PH model. Name the fitted model <code>fit1</code>.</p>
<p>The aim here is to do a realistic analysis of a survival dataset with a Cox PH model. Hence,</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Start by checking if the interaction effects can be dropped using a likelihood ratio test.</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly check if the nonlinear effects can be dropped using a likelihood ratio test.</p></li>
<li><p>For the final model check the PH assumption for the terms in the model.</p></li>

<h3>Question 3</h3>
<p>For the rest of the questions we consider the additive Cox PH model with <code>sex</code>, <code>age</code> and <code>ph.karno</code> fitted in the original <code>lung</code> database (i.e., not the two databases before and after 170 days). It is believed that the baseline hazard of death has a completely different shape for patients with ECOG score greater than 0 compared to patients with ECOG equal to 0, i.e., the hazard functions of the two groups is not analogous. First, from the <code>ph.ecog</code> variable that takes values from 0 to 3, construct the variable <code>ph.ecog2</code> that groups together the values 1-3. Then, fit an appropriate Cox model that takes the feature described above into account, and then interpret the results. Name the fitted model <code>fit5</code>.</p>

<h3>Question 4</h3>
<p>The team of physicians of the North Central Cancer Treatment Group (who are responsible for the Lung study) believe that the effects of <code>sex</code>, <code>age</code> and <code>ph.karno</code> in the risk of death are different for the two ECOG groups. Extend the model <code>fit5</code> of Q3 accordingly, and test whether this hypothesis is supported by the data for each of the two predictors.</p>
